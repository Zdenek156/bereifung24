- Update/delete events when appointments change

**Scopes Requested:**
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar (to create, read, update, delete calendar events)

**Data Usage:**
- Calendar data is only used for appointment management
- No data is shared with third parties
- Data is stored securely in our PostgreSQL database
- Users can disconnect their calendar at any time from the workshop settings page
- Upon disconnection, all calendar tokens are immediately deleted from our database

Our privacy policy is available at: https://bereifung24.de/datenschutz
It includes detailed information about:
- What data we collect and why
