Subject: RE: EPREL API - Still 403 Forbidden with Corrected Key

Dear DG ENER Product Energy Efficiency Team,

Thank you for pointing out the typo in the API key. We have corrected it as instructed:

CORRECTED API KEY:
cllIkTy1kZ4DRqCQlQzoC7FvNj3jh1Ys6UErv6nP (with TWO lowercase "l" at the beginning)

However, we are still receiving 403 Forbidden errors when testing with the corrected key:

TESTED COMMAND (exactly as you provided):
curl -L -H "X-Api-Key: cllIkTy1kZ4DRqCQlQzoC7FvNj3jh1Ys6UErv6nP" https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/api/exportProducts/tyres

RESULT:
- Response: {"message":"Forbidden"}
- HTTP Status: 403
- File size: 23 bytes

TESTED FROM:
- Server IP: 167.235.24.110
- Location: Hetzner Cloud, Germany
- Time: 2026-01-27 11:23 UTC (just now)
- Multiple retests with same result

VERIFICATION:
We confirmed the API key is sent correctly in the request header:
[x-api-key: cllIkTy1kZ4DRqCQlQzoC7FvNj3jh1Ys6UErv6nP]

QUESTIONS:
1. Could you please verify that this API key is actually activated in your system?
2. Is there a delay in activation after the correction?
3. Are there any IP restrictions or whitelisting requirements despite your earlier confirmation?
4. Could you test the API key from your side to confirm it works?

We want to implement the EU Tyre Label data in our smart tire advisor to help customers make informed decisions. Your assistance in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your patience and support.
