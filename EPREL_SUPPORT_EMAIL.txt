Subject: EPREL Public API - 403 Forbidden Error with Valid API Key

Dear EPREL API Support Team,

We have received an API key for the EPREL Public API (Key: clIkTy1kZ4DRqCQlQzoC7FvNj3jh1Ys6UErv6nP) but are unable to access any API endpoints. All requests consistently return a 403 Forbidden error.

TESTED ENDPOINTS (ALL FAILED WITH 403):
Production Environment:
- https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/api/v1.0.92/exportProducts/tyres
- https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/api/exportProducts/tyres
- https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/api/v1.0.92/products/tyres
- https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/api/products/tyres

Acceptance Environment:
- https://public-energy-label-acceptance.ec.europa.eu/api/v1.0.92/exportProducts/tyres
- https://public-energy-label-acceptance.ec.europa.eu/api/exportProducts/tyres

REQUEST DETAILS:
- Method: GET
- Header: X-API-KEY: clIkTy1kZ4DRqCQlQzoC7FvNj3jh1Ys6UErv6nP
- Header: Accept: application/json
- Response: 403 Forbidden (all endpoints)

QUESTIONS:
1. Is the API key valid and active?
2. Does our server IP address need to be whitelisted?
3. Are we using the correct endpoint URLs and headers?
4. Is there additional authentication required beyond the X-API-KEY header?
5. Which specific endpoint should we use to retrieve tyre data?

OUR SETUP:
- Company: Bereifung24
- Server IP: 167.235.24.110 (Hetzner)
- Use case: Tire recommendation system for customers
- Application: Next.js web application

We followed the documentation from:
- EPREL Public API key PDF document received via email
- Wiki page: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/spaces/EPREL/
